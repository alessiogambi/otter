"""
The Otter Controller:  Because otherwise your otters will make a mess of your
house.  Don't believe me?  There are videos on pet otters on youtube!

The Otter Controller manages a set of non-user visible state information for
each group, holds a lock on that state information, receives events from the
model object (group config change, scaling policy execution), and receives
events from the supervisor (job completed)

TODO:
 * Lock yak shaving
 * Eviction policy

Storage model for state information:
 * active list
    * Instance links
    * Created time
 * pending list
    * Job ID
 * last touched information for group
 * last touched information for policy
